# What is a PWA?

*TLWNR:*

* A Progressive Web App is a web app that has been enhanced to improve the user experience
**based on the app's context**.

*Mr speaker, Could you say that again but like make it longer?*

Sure,

* A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a **web app** that uses **modern web technlogies** such as web app manifest, service workers and IndexedDB to deliver an experience that is **fast**, **reliable** and **engaging**.
A PWA is expected to **harness the power of the platform** it's on and **gracefully adapt** to situation changes such as loss of internet connection.

<--How many are familiar with PWAs-->

# Progressive Enhancement

  A continous almost obssesive improvement of your app, to make sure <br> 
  that your users have the best possible experience.


  * Remember, **progressively** enhance your app

    * *PWA stack can be overwhelming especially if you already have an app in place.*

  * PWA technologies don't magically fix all your app's problems

    * *They build upon the existing experience*

    * *First optimize your traditional wep app*

  * Not all PWA technologies work on every browser

    * *Users without the latest and greatest benefit from an optimal experience.*

class: middle

  ## Before you PWA
  
  Make your app small:

  * Compress, resize and scale your images

  * Use SVGs instead of font icons when possible.

  * Don't use a library or framework to do a script or css file job

  * Bundle and Minify your source files

---

name: Make app fast
class: middle

  ## Before you PWA cont...

  Make your app fast:

  * Use placeholders until content loads *e.g. dominant color for images*

  * Use **lightweight** loaders / state change notifiers

  * (*when possible*) Find ways around traditional form input

    * *Stlyed label tags instead of radio/check inputs*

  * Use alternative solutions to long tasks

    * *One Click SignIn, Web Pay API*
  
  * Use web workers for memory intensive tasks

  * Test it on Googleâ€™s PageSpeed Insights

name: Make app nativey
class: middle
## Before you PWA cont...
  
Give your app a native feel (*think beyond links and pages*)

  * Make your apps responsive (*like beyond media queries responsive*)

  * Enhance user input ( *don't default to input boxes* )

  * Add microinteractions
  
  * Make state changes smooth, snappy and intuitive (*transitions and animations*)

  * Customize empty states screens and error screens (*e.g no network*)
  
  * Reward successfull interactions ( *nice message, graphic* )

  * Use context links ( *tel: +255 7....*, *wa.me/155...?text=I'm int...* )

  * Feedback, feedback, feedback

name: Know your app / tools
class: middle
## PWA beyond the basics

* Know your app

  * Optimize based on your app's specific context

  * E.g. an image based app needs to focus highly on optimizing images.

  * A kids website needs to maximize playfulness.

* Know your tools
  
  * Research on ways to optimize your vanilla code, library or framework.

* Small lightweight app shell (*inline styles*)

* Cache assets (Service Worker, Web Cache API)

---

name: Test app
class: middle
## PWA beyond the basics cont...

* Test your app with actual users

  * Non technical friends, family

  * Give to small unit of target users

* Test and adapt your app to realistic network conditions

  * Most users are probably on 3G or lower

  * Use Cache API and IndexedDB for file and content caching

  * Notify users on network state changes and give them options

    * E.g. *Google search caches search queries, replays them when 
    connections is next available then notifies user*

* Use analytics tools to track app usage

  * Which features are never used 
  (* hamburger menu for tz websites *)

  * Experiment with unfamiliar interactions or content structure
